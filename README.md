# hw3-numerical-modeling
This is the CPP directory for question 1 of my homework 3. The point is mainly to solve the diffusion advection equation, nondimensionalizing it, and testing different temporal/spatial resolutions. Question 2 will focus on EBMs

Here's the file tree:
```
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── build.sh
├── include
│   └── DiffusionModel.h
├── out
└── 
    ├── DiffusionModel.cpp
    └── main.cpp

4 directories, 7 files
```
All the CMake build files go into /out
